Execute MySQL Server and define a new user : 

```
mysql> CREATE USER "[USERNAME]"@"localhost";
mysql> SET password FOR "[USERNAME]"@"localhost" = password('[PASSWORD]');
```


## How to use :

### Environment variables :

#### Required :

You need to create database for MySQL using : `$ NODE_ENV=DEV DB_USER=[username] DB_PASSWORD=[password] node server/create_database.js`


#### Optionnal :

To set a custom port use `$ PORT=[xxxx] ...` (default port is 3000)

To receive mail notifications, use `$ MAIL_ALERT=["yourMailAdress"] ...`
