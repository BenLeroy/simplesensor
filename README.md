```

Execute MySQL Server and define a new user : 

```
mysql> CREATE USER "[USERNAME]"@"localhost";
mysql> SET password FOR "[USERNAME]"@"localhost" = password('[PASSWORD]');
```

You need to create database for MySQL using : `$ NODE_ENV=DEV DB_USER=[username] DB_PASSWORD=[password] node server/create_database.js`


## How to use :


Run : `$ [ENV_VARS] npm start` from project's root (`$ cd simplesensor`)

Then go with your favorite browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)


### Environment variables :

#### Required :

You must define MySQL connection by using : `$ DB_USER=[username] DB_PASSWORD=[password] ...`


#### Optionnal :
